    "### Level 1 - Character splitting\n",
    "\n",
    "Es el metodo de *chunking* mas simple y basica, es el proceso por el cual solo dividimos el texto en *chunks* de tamaño *N* caracteres sin importar su contenido o forma.\n",
    "\n",
    "Este metodo **NO** es recomendado para ninguna aplicación, pero puede ser un buen punto de partida para entender los fundamentos.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pros: facil y rapido\n",
    "- Cons: Muy rigido y no toma en cuenta la estructura del texto\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptos:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Chunk size**: El número de caracteres que define el largo del chunk.\n",
    "- **Chunk overlap**: La cantidad de caracteres que tiene que sobrelaparse en chunks secuenciales. Esto es para evitar cortar el contexto en multiples partes, perdiendo el significado semantico de algún pasaje. Esto creara duplicados entre los chunks."
