    "## Late interaction embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "- Late interaction embeddings refer to a hybrid approach where sparse and dense embeddings are combined during the retrieval process, but their interactions are delayed until the final ranking or matching phase. This allows the model to first retrieve candidates based on simpler, faster methods and then refine the ranking through more complex, dense representations. In RAG, this helps improve retrieval quality while balancing computational efficiency."
